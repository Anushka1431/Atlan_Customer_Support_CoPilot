# Multi-Agent Customer Support Copilot

A **multi-agent AI-powered customer support platform** designed to ingest, classify, and respond to support tickets efficiently. The system combines a **Fast MCP server and client** with a **Streamlit orchestrator**, and leverages **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for knowledge-grounded responses.

## üìù Overview

This project provides a **multi-agent AI support system** that enables:

1. **Bulk Ticket Classification Dashboard**: Displays tickets from a sample file with AI-generated classifications (Topic, Sentiment, Priority).
2. **Interactive AI Agent**: Submit new tickets and view both **internal AI analysis** and **final responses**.
3. **Backend Integration**: A **Fast MCP server** manages AI logic and agent orchestration.
4. **Frontend Orchestration**: **Streamlit UI** acts as the orchestrator for displaying analyses and responses in real time.
5. **Live Chat**: Support for **typed chat** integration.

**Problem Statement**: Build a core AI pipeline to ingest, classify, and respond to support tickets, demonstrated through a functional dummy helpdesk.

## ü§ñ Proposed Agents

### 1. Classification Agent

- **Purpose**: Analyze tickets and assign metadata including topic classification, sentiment analysis, and priority assignment.
- **Tech**: LLaMA via HuggingFace for zero/few-shot classification, Sentence-transformers for sentiment analysis, and rule-based fallback for priority determination.

### 2. RAG Agent

- **Purpose**: Answer knowledge-grounded queries by retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base and generating contextual responses.
- **Tech**: ChromaDB for persistent vector storage, advanced embeddings models, optional reranking for improved accuracy, and LLaMA for response synthesis.

### 3. Routing Agent

- **Purpose**: Handle tickets outside RAG scope by intelligently routing them to appropriate teams or escalation paths.
- **Tech**: Deterministic routing logic based on ticket classification and predefined rules.

### 4. Feedback Agent

- **Purpose**: Log evaluator corrections and user feedback to continuously improve the system's performance.
- **Tech**: Lightweight logging system that stores feedback data for model retraining and performance optimization.

## üèó Architecture

The system follows a multi-layer architecture with the Streamlit UI orchestrator at the frontend, handling live chat, bulk and single ticket input. This connects to a Fast MCP Server that manages four specialized agents: Classification, RAG, Routing, and Feedback. The backend integrates with data storage, knowledge base, and ChromaDB vector database for comprehensive ticket processing and response generation.

## ‚öñ Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture** ‚Äì Provides modularity and extensibility for different ticket processing needs.
2. **Fast MCP Server** ‚Äì Ensures lightweight, asynchronous, and modular API exposure.
3. **Streamlit Frontend** ‚Äì Offers intuitive dashboards and real-time updates via Server-Sent Events.
4. **RAG Integration** ‚Äì Balances retrieval quality with response latency for optimal user experience.
5. **Modular Design** ‚Äì Enables easy maintenance, testing, and future enhancements.

## ‚öô Setup & Installation

### Project Structure

The project follows a clean separation between backend and frontend components, with the backend containing all AI agents and the MCP server, while the frontend handles the Streamlit UI orchestration.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git for cloning the repository

### Local Development Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from your version control system and navigate to the project directory.

#### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the root directory, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies. 
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following configuration:

HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
HF_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct:cerebras
HF_API_URL=https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000/sse
PROJECT_ROOT=your_project_root_directory


Replace the placeholder values with your actual:

HF_TOKEN: Your HuggingFace API token for model access

HF_API_URL: Your specific HuggingFace API endpoint URL

PROJECT_ROOT: Full path to your project root directory

Then run the following commands and start the MCP server which will run on port 8000.

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/knowledge_base/atlan_info.py
python backend/main_mcp_server.py
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, install the frontend dependencies, and launch the Streamlit application.

```bash
pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
streamlit run frontend/app3.py
```

#### 4. Access the Application

Once both services are running:
- Frontend UI: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## üöÄ Usage

### Features

- **Bulk Ticket Classification**: Load and analyze sample tickets with automatic topic classification, sentiment analysis, and priority assignment
- **Single Ticket Classification**: Analyze single ticket with automatic topic classification, sentiment analysis, and priority assignment
- **Interactive AI Agent**: Submit new support tickets through the intuitive interface and receive real-time AI analysis and responses
- **Knowledge-Based Responses**: Get accurate, sourced responses through the RAG Agent that retrieves information from the knowledge base
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically route tickets that fall outside the knowledge base scope to appropriate teams or escalation paths
  
### Getting Started

Navigate to the frontend interface and explore the bulk classification feature with sample tickets. Try submitting new tickets through the interactive interface to see real-time AI processing. Experiment with the single ticket and live chat functionality for convenient ticket submission.
